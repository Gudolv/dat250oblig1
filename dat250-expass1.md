# Starting out with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

os:[Endeavour](https://endeavouros.com/)


## Technical problems during installation

I encounterd very few technical problems when installing Heroku and none of them directly related to Heroku. The first was finding the correct package for from the AUR which turned out to be just looking it up on the web.
The second was a random hardcrash on my laptop mid-install that caused the cache of yarn to become corrupted, making reinstalling heroku impossible before cleaning
the cache with "yarn cache clean" in the terminal.

## Validating that the software development environment is working

Following the tutorial, I made some of the changes in the **Main.java** file, commited these changes, pushed them and checked if the changes went through by running the application with "heroku open hello" .

## Technical problems with the heroku platform

I did not encounter any technical problems with the heroku platform except self-made ones, like a couple of typos in the java-code causing maven not to be able to build the app, easily fixed by correcting the typo.

## Pending issues

As far as I can see, I managed to do all the assignments from the tutorial
