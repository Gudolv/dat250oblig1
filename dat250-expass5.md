# Dat250 software experiment 5

## Technical problems

I had very few technical problems. The usual, atleast for me, problems with maven suddenly refusing to find certain plug-ins and some learning-issues with 
how and where to place packages. Otherwise everything seemed to work as intended. I still don't know, or understand, why maven keeps forgetting certain packages 
but it works most of the time.

## Pending Issues

Everything should be done, the only pending issues is getting maven to behave.
